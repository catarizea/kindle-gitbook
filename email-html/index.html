<div class="noteText">
As we’ve been practicing Lean UX, we’ve learned to overcome the feeling that we are showing work in an “unfinished” or “ugly” state. We now know that our first attempt will inevitably require revision. So the sooner we get our ideas out, the sooner we can figure out what those revisions should be.

Waiting too long to get that feedback is wasteful. We invest too much in the initial design and are less flexible to changes because of the effort we’ve already put in.

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 227
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When designing for physical materials, designers need to figure out what they’re making before they begin production, because production is expensive.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 235
</div>
<div class="noteText">
We are no longer limited by a physical manufacturing process, and are able to get our digital products and services into customers’ hands at a pace unheard of just five years ago. This changes everything.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 255

<div class="noteText">
Lean UX is deeply collaborative and cross- functional, because designers, product managers, and software engineers no longer have the luxury of working in isolation from each other.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 267

<div class="noteText">
It’s a culture change that lets us approach our work with humility; we acknowledge that our initial solutions will probably be wrong and use many sources of insight to continuously improve our thinking.

<div class="sectionHeading">
2. Principles
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 287
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The first foundation of Lean UX is user experience design. Lean UX is, at its heart, a way of practicing user experience design. Drawing on roots in the fields of human factors and ergonomics as well as the human- centered design ideas that emerged in the 1950s with the work of industrial designers like Henry Dreyfuss, today we call these methods and mindsets user experience design (or just UX), a term credited to Don Norman.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 294
</div>
<div class="noteText">
UX embraces a number of design fields, including interaction design, information architecture, graphic design, and many others. But the heart of UX practice is that it begins by identifying human needs— the needs of the users of the system.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 298
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Design Thinking emerged in the academy in the 1970s and 1980s and was popularized by the design firm IDEO in the early 2000s.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 300
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Tim Brown, CEO and president of IDEO, described Design Thinking as, “innovation powered by... direct observation of what people want and need in their lives and what they like or dislike about the way particular products are made, packaged, marketed, sold, and supported.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 304
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Design Thinking is important for Lean UX because it takes the explicit position that every aspect of a business (or any other system) can be approached with design methods. It gives designers permission to work beyond their typical boundaries. It also encourages nondesigners to use design methods to solve the problems they face in their roles.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
The final foundation of Lean UX is Eric Ries’s Lean Startup method. Lean Startup uses a feedback loop called “build- measure- learn” to minimize project risk and get teams building and learning quickly. Teams build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and ship them quickly to begin the process of learning as early as possible.

“Lean Startup processes reduce waste by increasing the frequency of contact with real customers, therefore testing and avoiding incorrect market assumptions as early as possible.”

<div class="noteText">
The smallest thing you can build to test each hypothesis is your MVP. The MVP doesn’t need to be made of code: it can be an approximation of the end experience— it might not even be a product!

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - So, What Is the Definition of Lean UX? >  Location 342
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Inspired by Lean Startup and Agile development, it’s the practice of bringing the true nature of a product to light faster, in a collaborative, cross- functional way. We work to build a shared understanding of the customer, their needs, our proposed solutions, and our definition of success. We prioritize learning over delivery to build evidence for our decisions.

Why do it? Diverse teams create better solutions, because each problem is seen from many different points of view. Creating diverse teams limits the need for gated, handoff- based (“ waterfall”) processes. Instead, teams can share information informally, which creates collaboration earlier in the process and drives greater team efficiency.

Why do it? When we attempt to predict which features will achieve specific outcomes, we are mostly engaging in speculation. Although it’s easier to manage the launch of specific feature sets, we often can’t predict if a feature will be effective until it’s in the market.

Why do it? Team resources are limited. The more a team can eliminate waste, the faster they can move. Teams want to work on the right challenges. They want to be effective. Thinking in terms of value creation and waste removal can help teams keep their laser focus where it belongs.

Why do it? Rock stars don’t share— neither their ideas nor the spotlight. Team cohesion breaks down when you add individuals with large egos who are determined to stand out and be stars.

<div class="noteText">
Why do it? Every project begins with assumptions. Large- batch design begins with those untested assumptions and creates a lot of design work on top of them. This means that if we find out that a foundational assumption is wrong, we must throw away a lot of work. By working in smaller batches, we can design and validate our decisions as we go, which reduces the risk of wasted work.

Why do it? Regular customer conversations provide frequent opportunities for validating new product ideas. By bringing the entire team into the research cycle, it develops empathy for users and the problems they face. You create shared understanding. Finally, as the team learns together, you reduce the need for future debrief conversations and documentation.

Blank realized that the endless meeting room debates about the customer couldn’t be settled inside the office. Blank’s prescription: give potential customers a chance to provide feedback on your ideas sooner than you would have in the past. Much sooner. Test your ideas with a strong dose of reality while they’re still young. Better to find out that your ideas are missing the mark before you’ve spent time and resources building a product that no one wants.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 561
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Traditionally, software projects are framed by requirements and deliverables. Teams are given requirements and are expected to produce deliverables that describe how the features that satisfy those requirements will look, behave, and perform. In many cases, the strategic context for those requirements is not communicated, is missing, or is simply not considered.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 565
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Lean UX radically shifts the way we frame our work by introducing back the strategic context for our feature and design choices and, more important, how we— the entire team, not just the design department— define success. Our goal is not to create a deliverable or a feature: it’s to positively affect customer behavior or change in the world— to create an outcome.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 573

<div class="noteText">
This reframing requires an organization- wide position of humility. It requires teams and managers to use their knowledge and skills and creativity as scientists might: they propose their best solution and then they test to see if they’re right.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 578

<div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
Language, in this case, is important. Requirements present a seemingly immutable path forward. Assumptions explicitly admit that we might be wrong. We use our assumptions to create and test hypotheses. If you’re familiar with Test- Driven Development (TDD), hypotheses are very similar. They are, in a way, a form of Test- Driven Product Design and Development. We write the test first— the hypothesis. We design and/ or develop just enough product (i.e., experiments and Minimum Viable Products [MVPs]) to see if the hypothesis is true.

This chapter digs into the main tool of outcome- focused work: the hypothesis statement. The hypothesis statement is the starting point for a project. It states a clear strategic vision for the work and shifts the conversation between teams, managers, and stakeholders from outputs (e.g., “We will build an iPhone app”) to outcomes (e.g., “We want to increase the amount of commerce that comes through our mobile channels.”)

<div class="noteText">
Without the evidence to confirm these statements, they are all assumptions, filled with risk. Every downstream decision we make based on untested assumptions increases the risk of failure in our product. So when we find an assumption, we need to ask, How might we ensure that these statements are true as quickly (and cheaply) as possible so that future decisions stand a better chance of succeeding?

Declaring your assumptions allows your team to create a common starting point.

As with the other elements of the hypothesis statement, we like to start the persona creation process with a brainstorm. Team members offer up their opinions on who the project should be targeting and how that would affect their use of the product. When the brainstorming is complete, the team should narrow down the ideas to an initial set of three to four personas they believe are most likely to be their target audience. You should try to differentiate the personas around needs and roles rather than by demographic information.

It’s also not unusual to create a hypothesis in which multiple features drive similar outcomes. When you see that happening, refine the hypothesis to focus on just one feature.

Hypotheses have behavior change (outcomes) as their definition of success. Shipping a working feature is table stakes. It’s the beginning of the conversation.

<div class="noteText">
Lean UX is an exercise in ruthless prioritization. It’s rare to have a project budget focused strictly on learning. In most cases, we need to ship product at some point, as well. The reason we declare our assumptions at the outset of our work is so that we can identify project risks. After we string them together into hypotheses we create a backlog of potential work. Next, we need to figure out which ones are the riskiest ones— so that we can work on them first.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Proto-Personas >  Location 984

This does not mean that assumptions that don’t make the first cut are gone forever. Keep a backlog of the other hypotheses you’ve created so that you can come back to them and test them if and when it makes sense to do so.

<div class="noteText">
What is a “user experience”? It’s the sum total of all of the interactions a user has with your product and service. It’s created by all of the decisions that you and your team make about your product or service: the way you price it, the way you package and sell it, the way you onboard users, the way you support it and maintain it and upgrade it, and so on and so on. In other words, it’s created by a team, not an individual user interface designer. For this reason, Lean UX begins with the idea that user experience design should be a collaborative process.

<div class="noteText">
In Chapter 3, you learned about hypotheses. To test your hypotheses, you sometimes simply conduct research (described in Chapter 6). But other times, you need to design and build something that will help you to test these hypotheses. For example, if you’re in the early stage of a project, you might test demand by creating a landing page that will measure how many customers sign up for your service. Or if you’re later in the product lifecycle, you might be working at the feature level— adding some new functionality that will make users more productive, for example.

The most effective way we’ve found to rally a team around a design direction is through collaboration. Over the long haul, collaboration yields better results than hero- based design (the practice of calling in a designer or design team to drop in, come up with something beautiful, and take off to rescue the next project).

Collaborative design is an approach that allows a team to design together. It helps teams build a shared understanding of both the design problem and the solution. It provides the means for them to work together to decide which functionality and interface elements best implement the feature they want to create.

In a typical collaborative design session, teams sketch together, critique the work as it emerges, and ultimately converge on a solution they feel has the greatest chance of success. The designer, while still producing designs, takes on the additional role of facilitator to lead the team through a series of exercises.

Jeff sketched his original idea about how to lay out all of the content and functionality for this dashboard (see Figure 4- 2). The two of them then discussed the idea, and eventually Jeff handed Greg the marker. He sketched his ideas on the same whiteboard. They went back and forth, ultimately converging on a layout and flow that they felt was both usable and feasible, given that they needed to deliver a solution within the current two- week sprint. At the end of that two- hour session, they returned to their desks and began working. Jeff refined the sketch into a more formal wireframe and workflow while Greg began to write the infrastructure code necessary to get the data they needed to the presentation layer.

By having these conversations early and often, the team is aware of everyone’s ideas and can get started on their own work earlier. If they know that the proposed solution requires a certain backend infrastructure, for example, the team’s engineers can get started on that work while the design is refined and finalized. Parallel paths for software development and design are the fastest route to reach an actual experience.

Now ask everyone to pair up for the next round. (If two people at the table had similar ideas, it’s a good idea to ask them to work together.)

Now that all team members have feedback on their individual ideas and people have paired up to develop ideas further, the team must converge on one idea. In this step, the team is trying to select the ideas they feel have the best chance for success. This set of ideas will serve as the basis for the next step in the Lean UX process: creating an MVP and running experiments (both covered in the next chapter).

So far in this chapter, we’ve focused on the ways that teams can design together. In practice, this usually means that teams are sketching together, either on paper or at a whiteboard. It almost never means that teams are sitting together at a workstation moving pixels around. In fact, this kind of group hovering at the pixel level is what most designers would consider their worst nightmare. (To be clear: don’t do this.)

Increasingly, we’re seeing teams turn to design systems. Design systems are like style guides on steroids. They were an emerging species when we completed the first edition of this book but have now become an accepted best practice for digital product teams. Large organizations like Westpac (see Figure 4- 8) and GE use them. Technology- native companies like MailChimp and Medium and Salesforce and countless others use them, too.

The computing world’s version of a style guide is exemplified by Apple’s famous Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). The HIG is a comprehensive document that explains every component in Apple’s operating system, provides rules for using the components, and contains examples that demonstrate proper use of the components.

Finally, developers are familiar with asset libraries. These collections of reusable code elements are intended to make the developer’s job easier by providing tested, reusable code that’s easy to download from an always- current code repository.

As with many ideas in the digital world, digital design systems (which we’ll call design systems for the sake of brevity) are a kind of mash up of all of these ideas. A good design system contains comprehensive documentation of the elements of a design, rules and examples that govern the use of these elements, and crucially, contains the code and other assets that actually implement the design.

In 2012, GE opened GE Software in San Ramon, California. This new “Center of Excellence” (CoE) was designed to help GE improve its software game. A few years earlier, a strategic review helped the company to see just how central software had become to their business— measured in lines of code, GE was something like the 17th largest software company in the world. And yet they felt they were not treating software development with the focus it deserved.

The team’s first design system, called IIDS, for the Industrial Internet Design System, was designed by a group of internal designers with the help of a small team from Frog Design, one of the leading design firms in the world. The team built the system on top of Bootstrap, the HTML/ CSS framework created by Twitter. It proved incredibly successful.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Systems >  Location 1249
</div>
<div class="noteText">
With that success came some problems. To be sure, simply having a good UI kit doesn’t mean that a team can produce a well- designed product. Design systems don’t solve every design problem. And Bootstrap was showing its limits as a platform choice. It had helped the team achieve their first objectives: get something out quickly, provide broad coverage of UI elements, and create wide adoption by being easier to use than “roll- your- own” solutions. But Bootstrap was hard to maintain and update and was just too big for most needs.

In 2015, GE Software, having had great success as an internal service bureau, morphed into GE Digital, a revenue- generating business in its own right. Their first product was called Predix (Figure 4- 9), a platform on top of which developers inside and outside of GE can build software for industrial applications.

<div class="noteHeading">

The team chose to move the design system to a new technology platform. No longer based on Bootstrap, the system has instead been created with Polymer, a JavaScript framework that allows the team to implement Web Components. Web Components has emerged in the last few years as a way to enable more mature frontend development practices.

To create the new design system, the team spent nearly six months prototyping. Significantly, the team did not work in isolation. Instead, they paired with one of the application teams, and thus were designing components to meet the needs of their users— in this case the designers and developers working on the application teams. This point is really important.

Next, include all visual design elements. Begin with the general color palette of your product. Ensure that each primary color is available with hex values along with complementary and secondary color choices. If certain elements, like buttons, for example, have different colors based on state, include this information in the description. Other elements to include here are logos, headers, footers, grid structures, and typographical choices (i.e., which fonts to use where and at what size/ weight). The same attributes of what, where, and when provided for interaction design elements should also be provided here.

Physical distance is one of the biggest challenges to strong collaboration. Some of the methods we’ve discussed in this chapter— especially Design Studio— become more difficult when a team isn’t all in the same location. But you still find ways to collaborate. Tools such as Skype, Google Hangouts, and Slack can provide teams with the means to collaborate in real time. Google Docs (including Google Draw) and purpose- built services like Mural.com allow teammates to collaborate on a document at the same time. Trello and wikis make it possible for teams to track information together.

We asked the two groups to gather in their individual conference rooms with their own laptops. Each conference room had a Mac in it with a location- specific Skype account (that is, it wasn’t a specific individual’s account— it was an “office” account). The two offices connected to each other via their office Skype accounts so that we could see each other as a group. This visual element was critical because it was the closest we could get to physically being in the same room.

To set up for the next step, a Design Studio session, we tried to mimic a colocated version of the activity as much as possible. We provided paper and pens at each location.

Not every team will find that collaboration comes easily. Most of us begin our careers by developing our individual technical skills as designers, developers, and so on. And in many organizations, collaboration across disciplines is rare. So it’s no wonder that it can feel challenging.

One of the most powerful tools for improving collaboration is the Agile technique of the retrospective and the related practice of creating Team Working Agreements. Retrospectives are regularly scheduled meetings, usually held at the end of every sprint, in which the team takes an honest look back at the past sprint.

<div class="noteHeading">

A Team Working Agreement is a document that serves as a partner to the retrospective. It keeps track of how the team has chosen to work together. It’s a self- created, continuously updated rule book that the team agrees to follow.

Collaborative design (Figure 4- 15) is an evolution of the UX design process. In this chapter, we discussed how opening up the design process brings the entire team deeper into the project. We talked about how the low- fidelity drawings created in Design Studio sessions can help teams generate many ideas and then converge on a set that the entire team can get behind. We showed you practical techniques you can use to create shared understanding— the fundamental currency of Lean UX.

Lean UX makes heavy use of the notion of MVP. MVPs help us test our assumptions— will this tactic achieve the desired outcome?— while minimizing the work we put into unproven ideas. The sooner we can find which features are worth investing in, the sooner we can focus our limited resources on the best solutions to our business problems.

The phrase MVP has caused a lot of confusion in its short life. The problem is that it gets used in two different ways. Sometimes, teams create an MVP primarily to learn something. They’re not concerned with delivering value to the market— they’re just trying to figure out what the market wants.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - What Is an MVP Anyway? >  Location 1470
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In other cases, teams create a small version of a product or a feature because they want to start delivering value to the market as quickly as possible. In this second case, if you design and deploy the MVP correctly, you should also be able to learn from it, even if that’s not the primary focus.

Example: Should We Launch a Newsletter?

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - What Is an MVP Anyway? >  Location 1473
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Let’s take, for example, a medium- sized company we consulted with recently. They were exploring new marketing tactics and wanted to launch a monthly newsletter. Newsletter creation is no small task. You need to prepare a content strategy, editorial calendar, layout and design, as well as an ongoing marketing and distribution strategy. You need writers and editors to work on it. All in all, it was a big expenditure for the company to undertake. The team decided to treat this newsletter idea as a hypothesis.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - What Is an MVP Anyway? >  Location 1478
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The team asked themselves: What’s the most important thing we need to know first? The answer: Was there enough customer demand for a newsletter to justify the effort?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - What Is an MVP Anyway? >  Location 1480
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The MVP the company used to test the idea was a sign- up form on their current website. The sign- up form promoted the newsletter and asked for a customer’s email address.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - What Is an MVP Anyway? >  Location 1483

<div class="noteText">
The team spent half a day designing and coding the form and was able to launch it that same afternoon.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - What Is an MVP Anyway? >  Location 1485

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">

</div>
<div class="noteText">
After the team had gathered enough data from their first experiment, and if the data showed that its customers wanted the newsletter, the team would move on to their next MVP, one that would begin to deliver value and create deeper learning around the type of content, presentation format, frequency, social distribution, and the other things they would need to learn to create a good newsletter.

When it comes to creating an MVP, the first question is always what is the most important thing we need to learn next? In most cases, the answer to that will either be a question of value or a question of implementation.

<div class="noteHeading">

The answer to the second question is your MVP. You will use your MVP to run experiments and the outcome of those experiments will inform you as to whether your hypothesis was correct.

After you’ve proven demand for your idea, a Wizard of Oz MVP can help you to figure out the mechanics of your product. This type of MVP looks like a fully functioning digital service to the user. Behind the scenes though, the data and communication with the initial set of users is handled manually by humans.

Our client, Taproot Foundation, had been helping pro bono volunteers and nonprofit organizations find each other for years, but they had always delivered this matching service “by hand,” through phone calls, emails, and in- person meetings. Now, they wanted to bring that process online: they wanted to create a website that would act as a two- sided marketplace for pro bono volunteers and the organizations that could benefit from their services.

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Examples of MVPs >  Location 1621

<div class="noteText">
We decided this was a perfect time to create a Wizard of Oz MVP. We built a simple website, handcoding just the few static pages that we needed to make it look like we were open for business.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Examples of MVPs >  Location 1622

We began with about a dozen pages in all: one index page, and then a page for each of the 12 pilot projects we had lined up. Behind the scenes, we had a community manager assemble a list of potential volunteers, and we emailed them, sending them a call to action and a link to our new site.

One of the most effective ways to create MVPs is by prototyping the experience. A prototype is an approximation of an experience that allows you to simulate what it is like to use the product or service in question.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Prototyping >  Location 1644

Case Study: Three Users Every Thursday at Meetup
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Continuous Learning >  Location 1891
</div>
<div class="noteText">
One company that has taken the concept of “three users every Thursday” to a new level is Meetup. Based in New York City and under the guidance of Chief Strategy Officer Andres Glusman, Meetup started with a desire to test each and every one of their new features and products.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Continuous Learning >  Location 1898
</div>
<div class="noteText">
They got some decent results from this approach— the company learned a lot about the products they were testing but found the test participants could feel uncomfortable with so many folks in the room.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Continuous Learning >  Location 1899
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Over time Meetup evolved to having the testing in one room with only the moderator joining the user. The rest of the team would watch the video feed from a separate conference room or at their desks. (Meetup originally used Morae to share the video. Today they use GoToMeeting.)
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Continuous Learning >  Location 1901
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Meetup doesn’t write testing scripts, because they’re not sure what will be tested each day. Instead, product managers and designers talk with the moderator before a test to identify key assumptions and key focus areas for the test. Then, the moderator and team interact with test moderators using instant messaging to help guide the conversations with users. The team debriefs immediately after the tests are complete and are able to move forward quickly.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Continuous Learning >  Location 1906

Meetup’s practical minimum viable process orientation can be seen in their approach to mobile testing, as well. As their mobile usage numbers grew, Meetup didn’t want to delay testing on mobile platforms while waiting for fancy mobile testing equipment. Instead, the company built their own— for $ 28 (see Figure 6- 3).

For example, over the course of regular test sessions from 2008 to 2011, the team at the TheLadders watched an interesting change in their customers’ attitudes over time. In 2008, when they first began meeting with job seekers on a regular basis, they would discuss various ways to communicate with employers. One of the options they proposed was SMS.

By 2011 though, SMS messages had taken off in the United States. As text messaging gained acceptance in business culture, audience attitudes began to soften.

Moving into high- fidelity visual- design assets, you receive much more detailed feedback. Test participants will be able to respond to branding, aesthetics, and visual hierarchy, as well as aspects of figure/ ground relationships, grouping of elements, and the clarity of your calls to action. Your test participants will also (almost certainly) weigh in on the effectiveness of your color palette. (See Figure 6- 6.)

Popularized by product management guru Marty Cagan, dual- track Agile is an attempt to build a continuous product discovery and delivery model for Scrum teams. It champions a process in which teams manage two backlogs— a discovery backlog and a delivery backlog. They work through their discovery backlogs with only validated items graduating into the delivery cycle. In many ways, if executed well, this is the end state most teams should strive for; however, it is not without its challenges.

In May 2007, Desiree Sy and Lynn Miller published “Adapting Usability Investigations for Agile User- centered Design” in the Journal of Usability Studies. 1 Sy and Miller were some of the first people to try to combine Agile and UX, and many of us were excited by the solutions they were proposing.

In short, Sy and Miller described a process in which design activity takes place one sprint ahead of development. Work is designed and validated during the “design sprint” and then passed off into the development stream to be implemented during the development sprint, as is illustrated in Figure 7- 1.

Many teams have misinterpreted this model, though. Sy and Miller always advocated strong collaboration between designers and developers during both the design and development sprints. Many teams have missed this critical point and instead have created workflows in which designers and developers communicate by handoff— creating a kind of mini- waterfall process.

Here’s why: it becomes very easy to create a situation in which the entire team is never working on the same thing at the same time. You never realize the benefits of cross- functional collaboration because the different disciplines are focused on different things. Without that collaboration, you don’t build shared understanding, so you end up relying heavily on documentation and handoffs for communication.

Design sprints are exciting, high- energy bursts of work. But it’s hard to sustain that energy. We’ve seen teams emerge energized and motivated to get building.

Agile methods can create a lot of time pressure on designers. Some work fits easily into the context of a user story. Other work needs more time to get right. Two- week cycles of concurrent development and design offer few opportunities for designers to ruminate on big problems.

And although some Agile methods take a more flexible approach to time than Scrum does (for example, Kanban does away with the notion of a two- week batch of work, and places the emphasis on continuous flow), most designers feel pressure to fit their work into the time- box of the sprint. For this reason, designers need to participate in the sprint- planning process.

For example, imagine at the beginning of a sprint that the first story a team prioritizes has a heavy design component to it. Imagine that the designer was not there to voice her concern. That team will fail as soon as they meet for their stand- up the next day.

The other casualty of sparse participation is shared understanding. Teams make decisions in meetings. Those decisions are based on discussions.

In my work as a product designer, I use Lean UX practices on a variety of projects. Recently I’ve worked on entertainment, ecommerce, and social- media products for different platforms, including iPad, iPhone, and the Web. The teams have been small, ranging from three to seven people. Most of my projects also share the following characteristics:

While working on Knowsy, I looked for ways that I could make my UX practice more quick, visual, collaborative, and continuous. I looked for opportunities to work in real time with other people on the team (such as developers and the product manager) and rough things out as quickly as possible at the lowest responsible level of fidelity.

As we sketched, I was able to point out inconsistencies by asking questions like, “What do we do when this happens?” This approach had the benefit of changing the dialog from, “I’m right- you’re wrong,” to “How do we solve this problem?”

After we had this basic agreement, I was able to create a paper prototype of the game based on the flow and we play tested it with the team. The effect on the team was immediate. Suddenly, everyone “got it” and was excited about what we were doing. People began to contribute ideas that fit well together, and we were able to identify what parts we could each work on that supported the whole.

For that go- around, I used a similar process. Because I was working remotely and the development team was not as available to collaborate, I had to make heavier deliverables. Nevertheless, the basic principle of iterating our way to higher fidelity continued.

Management check- ins are one of the biggest obstacles to maintaining team momentum. Designers are used to doing design reviews, but unfortunately, check- ins don’t end there. Product owners, stakeholders, CEOs, and clients all want to know how things are going.

They all want to bless the project plan going forward. The challenge for outcome- focused teams is that their project plans are dependent on what they are learning. They are responsive, so their typical plan lays out only small batches of work at a time. At most, these teams plan an iteration or two ahead. This perceived “short- sightedness” tends not to satisfy most high- level managers. How then do you keep the check- ins at bay while maintaining the pace of your Lean UX and Scrum processes?

Jeff once managed a team that radically altered the workflow for an existing product that had thousands of paying customers. The team was so excited by the changes they’d made that they went ahead with the launch without alerting anyone else in the organization.

Within an hour of the new product going live the vice president of customer service was at Jeff’s desk, fuming and demanding to know why she wasn’t told of this change. The issue was this: when customers have problems with the product, they call in for help. Call center representatives use scripts to troubleshoot customer problems and to offer solutions— except they didn’t have a script for this new product. Because they didn’t know it was going to change.

The concept of managing to outcomes applies to a set of teams as much as it does to individual ones. To ensure that all the teams working on the same project have a shared vision, assign them all the same success metric.
