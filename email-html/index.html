<div class="noteText">
As we’ve been practicing Lean UX, we’ve learned to overcome the feeling that we are showing work in an “unfinished” or “ugly” state. We now know that our first attempt will inevitably require revision. So the sooner we get our ideas out, the sooner we can figure out what those revisions should be.

Waiting too long to get that feedback is wasteful. We invest too much in the initial design and are less flexible to changes because of the effort we’ve already put in.

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 227
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When designing for physical materials, designers need to figure out what they’re making before they begin production, because production is expensive.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 235
</div>
<div class="noteText">
We are no longer limited by a physical manufacturing process, and are able to get our digital products and services into customers’ hands at a pace unheard of just five years ago. This changes everything.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 255

<div class="noteText">
Lean UX is deeply collaborative and cross- functional, because designers, product managers, and software engineers no longer have the luxury of working in isolation from each other.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Design Is Always Evolving >  Location 267

<div class="noteText">
It’s a culture change that lets us approach our work with humility; we acknowledge that our initial solutions will probably be wrong and use many sources of insight to continuously improve our thinking.

<div class="sectionHeading">
2. Principles
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 287
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The first foundation of Lean UX is user experience design. Lean UX is, at its heart, a way of practicing user experience design. Drawing on roots in the fields of human factors and ergonomics as well as the human- centered design ideas that emerged in the 1950s with the work of industrial designers like Henry Dreyfuss, today we call these methods and mindsets user experience design (or just UX), a term credited to Don Norman.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 294
</div>
<div class="noteText">
UX embraces a number of design fields, including interaction design, information architecture, graphic design, and many others. But the heart of UX practice is that it begins by identifying human needs— the needs of the users of the system.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 298
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Design Thinking emerged in the academy in the 1970s and 1980s and was popularized by the design firm IDEO in the early 2000s.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 300
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Tim Brown, CEO and president of IDEO, described Design Thinking as, “innovation powered by... direct observation of what people want and need in their lives and what they like or dislike about the way particular products are made, packaged, marketed, sold, and supported.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Foundations of Lean UX >  Location 304
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Design Thinking is important for Lean UX because it takes the explicit position that every aspect of a business (or any other system) can be approached with design methods. It gives designers permission to work beyond their typical boundaries. It also encourages nondesigners to use design methods to solve the problems they face in their roles.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
The final foundation of Lean UX is Eric Ries’s Lean Startup method. Lean Startup uses a feedback loop called “build- measure- learn” to minimize project risk and get teams building and learning quickly. Teams build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and ship them quickly to begin the process of learning as early as possible.

“Lean Startup processes reduce waste by increasing the frequency of contact with real customers, therefore testing and avoiding incorrect market assumptions as early as possible.”

<div class="noteText">
The smallest thing you can build to test each hypothesis is your MVP. The MVP doesn’t need to be made of code: it can be an approximation of the end experience— it might not even be a product!

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - So, What Is the Definition of Lean UX? >  Location 342
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Inspired by Lean Startup and Agile development, it’s the practice of bringing the true nature of a product to light faster, in a collaborative, cross- functional way. We work to build a shared understanding of the customer, their needs, our proposed solutions, and our definition of success. We prioritize learning over delivery to build evidence for our decisions.

Why do it? Diverse teams create better solutions, because each problem is seen from many different points of view. Creating diverse teams limits the need for gated, handoff- based (“ waterfall”) processes. Instead, teams can share information informally, which creates collaboration earlier in the process and drives greater team efficiency.

Why do it? When we attempt to predict which features will achieve specific outcomes, we are mostly engaging in speculation. Although it’s easier to manage the launch of specific feature sets, we often can’t predict if a feature will be effective until it’s in the market.

Why do it? Team resources are limited. The more a team can eliminate waste, the faster they can move. Teams want to work on the right challenges. They want to be effective. Thinking in terms of value creation and waste removal can help teams keep their laser focus where it belongs.

Why do it? Rock stars don’t share— neither their ideas nor the spotlight. Team cohesion breaks down when you add individuals with large egos who are determined to stand out and be stars.

<div class="noteText">
Why do it? Every project begins with assumptions. Large- batch design begins with those untested assumptions and creates a lot of design work on top of them. This means that if we find out that a foundational assumption is wrong, we must throw away a lot of work. By working in smaller batches, we can design and validate our decisions as we go, which reduces the risk of wasted work.

Why do it? Regular customer conversations provide frequent opportunities for validating new product ideas. By bringing the entire team into the research cycle, it develops empathy for users and the problems they face. You create shared understanding. Finally, as the team learns together, you reduce the need for future debrief conversations and documentation.

Blank realized that the endless meeting room debates about the customer couldn’t be settled inside the office. Blank’s prescription: give potential customers a chance to provide feedback on your ideas sooner than you would have in the past. Much sooner. Test your ideas with a strong dose of reality while they’re still young. Better to find out that your ideas are missing the mark before you’ve spent time and resources building a product that no one wants.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 561
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Traditionally, software projects are framed by requirements and deliverables. Teams are given requirements and are expected to produce deliverables that describe how the features that satisfy those requirements will look, behave, and perform. In many cases, the strategic context for those requirements is not communicated, is missing, or is simply not considered.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 565
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Lean UX radically shifts the way we frame our work by introducing back the strategic context for our feature and design choices and, more important, how we— the entire team, not just the design department— define success. Our goal is not to create a deliverable or a feature: it’s to positively affect customer behavior or change in the world— to create an outcome.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 573

<div class="noteText">
This reframing requires an organization- wide position of humility. It requires teams and managers to use their knowledge and skills and creativity as scientists might: they propose their best solution and then they test to see if they’re right.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - About Part II >  Location 578

<div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
Language, in this case, is important. Requirements present a seemingly immutable path forward. Assumptions explicitly admit that we might be wrong. We use our assumptions to create and test hypotheses. If you’re familiar with Test- Driven Development (TDD), hypotheses are very similar. They are, in a way, a form of Test- Driven Product Design and Development. We write the test first— the hypothesis. We design and/ or develop just enough product (i.e., experiments and Minimum Viable Products [MVPs]) to see if the hypothesis is true.

This chapter digs into the main tool of outcome- focused work: the hypothesis statement. The hypothesis statement is the starting point for a project. It states a clear strategic vision for the work and shifts the conversation between teams, managers, and stakeholders from outputs (e.g., “We will build an iPhone app”) to outcomes (e.g., “We want to increase the amount of commerce that comes through our mobile channels.”)

<div class="noteText">
Without the evidence to confirm these statements, they are all assumptions, filled with risk. Every downstream decision we make based on untested assumptions increases the risk of failure in our product. So when we find an assumption, we need to ask, How might we ensure that these statements are true as quickly (and cheaply) as possible so that future decisions stand a better chance of succeeding?

Declaring your assumptions allows your team to create a common starting point.

<div class="noteText">
As with the other elements of the hypothesis statement, we like to start the persona creation process with a brainstorm. Team members offer up their opinions on who the project should be targeting and how that would affect their use of the product. When the brainstorming is complete, the team should narrow down the ideas to an initial set of three to four personas they believe are most likely to be their target audience. You should try to differentiate the personas around needs and roles rather than by demographic information.

You’ll find during this exercise that there are gaps in your initial brainstorms.

It’s also not unusual to create a hypothesis in which multiple features drive similar outcomes. When you see that happening, refine the hypothesis to focus on just one feature. Hypotheses with multiple features are not easy to test. The important thing to remember in this entire process is to keep your ideas specific enough so that you can create meaningful tests to see if your ideas hold water.

Hypotheses have behavior change (outcomes) as their definition of success. Shipping a working feature is table stakes. It’s the beginning of the conversation. Our team’s success is not measured in how fast they can get features launched. Instead we measure success by how well our customers can achieve “some goal” initially and ongoing.

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Proto-Personas >  Location 976
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Lean UX is an exercise in ruthless prioritization. It’s rare to have a project budget focused strictly on learning. In most cases, we need to ship product at some point, as well. The reason we declare our assumptions at the outset of our work is so that we can identify project risks. After we string them together into hypotheses we create a backlog of potential work. Next, we need to figure out which ones are the riskiest ones— so that we can work on them first.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Proto-Personas >  Location 984

The higher the risk and the more perceived value involved, the higher the priority is to test those hypotheses first.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Proto-Personas >  Location 985
</div>
<div class="noteText">
This does not mean that assumptions that don’t make the first cut are gone forever. Keep a backlog of the other hypotheses you’ve created so that you can come back to them and test them if and when it makes sense to do so.

What is a “user experience”? It’s the sum total of all of the interactions a user has with your product and service. It’s created by all of the decisions that you and your team make about your product or service: the way you price it, the way you package and sell it, the way you onboard users, the way you support it and maintain it and upgrade it, and so on and so on. In other words, it’s created by a team, not an individual user interface designer. For this reason, Lean UX begins with the idea that user experience design should be a collaborative process.

In Chapter 3, you learned about hypotheses. To test your hypotheses, you sometimes simply conduct research (described in Chapter 6). But other times, you need to design and build something that will help you to test these hypotheses. For example, if you’re in the early stage of a project, you might test demand by creating a landing page that will measure how many customers sign up for your service. Or if you’re later in the product lifecycle, you might be working at the feature level— adding some new functionality that will make users more productive, for example.
